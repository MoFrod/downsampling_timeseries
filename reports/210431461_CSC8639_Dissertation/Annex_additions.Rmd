Figure 32 presents the feature with the seventh highest coefficient of variation (`DistributionExponentialFit_MAE` or `CO_Embed2_Dist_tau_d_expfit_meandiff`). To calculate the mean absolute error, this catch22 feature *"represents the time series in a two-dimensional time-delay embedding space... It then computes successive distances between points in this 2D embedding space and analyzes the probability distribution of these distances"* @feature_book. Initial visual analysis suggests that time series '600' and '800' are more affected by this feature.

```{r MAE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.with=3}
# Create the difference line graph for CO_Embed2_Dist_tau_d_expfit_meandiff

         filter(names == "DistributionExponentialFit_MAE"), 
       aes(x = as.numeric(vol), y = difference, color = method)) +
