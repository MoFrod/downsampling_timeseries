# downsampling_timeseries

Welcome!

Trusting data-driven decision-making goes beyond demonstrating comppliance with legal, regulatory and ethical obligations; decision makers need to trust how the data is used. 
Handling, storing and visualising the volume of data being generated today requires data practitioners to make assumptions and processing choices that remain opaque to decision-makers. 

The research explores decision-makers’ trust in data, data pracitioners’ experience of communicating data insights to decision makers and a new visualisation methodology for explaining the impact of downsampling on high-volume time series data. It is hoped this will improve decision-makers’ trust in data by helping data practitioners to create transparency in the data processing pipeline, communicate the impact of downsampling, and support conversations about which algorithms or parameters are most appropriate for particular decision-maker use cases.
